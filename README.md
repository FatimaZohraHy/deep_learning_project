## Roles and Responsibilities

### Front-end Developer (Angular / React JS)
- Develop the chatbot's user interface using **Angular** or **React JS**.
- Ensure that the frontend is intuitive and responsive for security analysts to interact with the chatbot seamlessly.
- Integrate the frontend with the backend APIs for real-time communication.

### Backend / CI/CD / Security
- Implement backend services to handle business logic and data processing.
- Design and manage the **CI/CD pipelines** to automate the testing, building, and deployment of the chatbot's microservices.
- Ensure the security of the backend systems and integrate security measures, including encryption and secure API handling.

### LLMs Responsible / MLOps
As the LLMs responsible, my role involves optimizing and fine-tuning pre-trained Language Understanding Models in our case we used the **llama3-8b** to ensure they accurately handle cybersecurity-related queries. This process is essential for adapting the models to our specific domain and use case. The fine-tuning steps include the following:
## 1. Fine-Tuning the Model

   Fine-tuning is a critical step to adapt the pre-trained models to the specific needs of cybersecurity-related question answering. The process involves the following steps:
   - **Step 1: Preparing the Dataset**
   To fine-tune the models, we start by collecting and structuring a dataset tailored to cybersecurity. The dataset contains cybersecurity-related question-answer pairs, formatted in a way that allows the model to learn from previous interactions and respond with relevant, domain-specific knowledge.
we also used **generated synthetic data** using LLMs you can find it here: **_https://huggingface.co/datasets/Joussef/my_sec_data_**
- **Step 2: Loading Pre-Trained Models**
   We begin by loading the pre-trained model, using a specialized framework like **_unsloth_** or **_transformers_**. This provides a strong foundation for the fine-tuning process since these models have already been trained on a large corpus of text data. By using these models, we can leverage their existing language capabilities while specializing them for cybersecurity tasks.
- **Step 3: Fine-Tuning the Model**
   The fine-tuning process involves training the model on our custom dataset. We adjust hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs to optimize the model's performance. During this step, the model learns how to respond accurately to cybersecurity-related queries, improving its ability to understand and generate relevant answers.
- **Step 4: Evaluation and Testing**
   After fine-tuning, the model is tested using a validation dataset to evaluate its performance. We look at various metrics such as accuracy, relevance, and response time to ensure that the model is responding correctly to cybersecurity questions.
- **Step 5: Saving and Deploying the Fine-Tuned Model**
   Once the model is fine-tuned and evaluated, we save it to a storage location. The fine-tuned model is then ready for deployment, where it will be integrated into the cybersecurity chatbot or other applications that require cybersecurity expertise.

## 2. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful architecture that enhances the ability of language models to generate accurate responses by combining a retrieval mechanism with generative capabilities. In this project, RAG is used to build a cybersecurity-focused chatbot capable of answering domain-specific queries by retrieving relevant context from a document database.
- **Step 1: Embedding Function**
- The embedding function is a critical component of RAG. It maps both documents and user queries into a shared vector space, enabling efficient similarity-based search. In this project, a pre-trained embedding model optimized for semantic understanding is used. This ensures that document embeddings capture the nuanced meanings necessary for accurate retrieval.
  - **Purpose**: Convert text data into numerical representations.
  - **Key Advantage**: Enables fast and meaningful comparisons between query and document content.
- **Step 2: Populating the Database**
- This step involves preparing the document database for retrieval. It consists of several sub-steps:
  1. Loading Documents:
     - Documents are imported from a directory containing PDF files.
     - This allows seamless integration of real-world documents into the system.
  2. Splitting Text into Chunks:
     - To optimize retrieval, documents are divided into smaller chunks of text
     - Overlapping chunks ensure no loss of context while maintaining manageable sizes for processing.
  3. Storing Embeddings in a Vector Database:
     - The text chunks are embedded into a vector database, ensuring that they can be retrieved based on their semantic similarity to user queries.
     - A persistent database is used to retain embeddings between sessions.
  4. Metadata Assignment:
     - Unique identifiers are created for each text chunk based on its source document and position.
     - This metadata ensures traceability and efficient retrieval of information.
- **Step 3: Querying the Database**
- Once the database is populated, it can be queried to retrieve relevant context for answering user questions. The workflow for querying involves:
  1. Retrieving Context:
     - The system uses a similarity-based search to find the most relevant text chunks from the database.
     - The top results are combined to form a comprehensive context.
  2. Generating a Response:
     - The retrieved context is used to generate a tailored response to the user query.
     - A fine-tuned language model is employed to ensure that the generated answers are accurate and domain-specific.
  3. Providing Sources:
     - Alongside the generated response, the system also outputs the source documents used in the answer.
     - This enhances transparency and trustworthiness.

### Diffusion Model Responsible / MLOps
- Develop and deploy **Diffusion Models** that simulate the spread of threats and vulnerabilities across networks.
- Integrate diffusion models with the chatbot's backend to predict future security risks based on historical data.
- Apply MLOps best practices for model management, including continuous training, monitoring, and versioning.

### DevOps Responsible / Monitoring
- Implement **DevOps** practices for infrastructure automation, continuous integration, and continuous deployment.
- Use tools like **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Terraform** to containerize and deploy microservices.
- Set up monitoring using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **ELK Stack** to track system performance and ensure uptime.

# Microservices Architecture with Spring Boot and Flask  

This project demonstrates a **microservices architecture** using Spring Boot for the core backend services and Flask for serving a fine-tuning machine learning model. Each service in the architecture is designed to be independently deployable, scalable, and maintainable.  

## Overview of Microservices  

Microservices architecture in Spring Boot is an approach to building an application as a collection of small, independently deployable services. Each service focuses on a specific business capability and communicates with others using lightweight protocols, typically HTTP. These services are often hosted in containers for scalability.  

### Key Features:  
- Independent services for specific functionalities.  
- Centralized service discovery using **Eureka**.  
- Gateway routing for efficient communication between clients and services.  
- JWT-based authentication for secure user management.  

---

## Services  

### 1. Eureka Discovery Service  

**Eureka** is a service registry provided by Netflix, integrated with Spring Cloud, that maintains a registry of all available services. It eliminates the need to hardcode service endpoints by allowing services to dynamically register and discover one another.  

#### Features:  
- **Service Registration:** Services automatically register themselves with the Eureka server when they start.  
- **Service Discovery:** Services query Eureka to dynamically locate other services.  

---

### 2. Gateway Service  

The **Gateway Service** serves as the single entry point for all client requests to the microservices. It routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservice and manages aspects such as security and monitoring.  

#### Features:  
- **Routing:** Forwards client requests based on route configuration.  
- **Security:** Integrates with authentication mechanisms like JWT.  

#### Example Configuration in `application.yml`:  
```yaml  
routes:  
  - id: users  
    uri: http://localhost:8090  
    predicates:  
      - Path=/user/**  
  - id: ftmodel  
    uri: http://localhost:5000  
    predicates:  
      - Path=/ft/**  
  - id: gar_gen  
    uri: http://localhost:5002  
    predicates:  
      - Path=/rag/**  
  - id: ai_gen  
    uri: http://localhost:5001  
    predicates:  
      - Path=/ai/**  
```
## 3. Authentication Service using JWT

The **Authentication Service** is responsible for verifying user credentials and generating **JWT (JSON Web Token)** tokens. JWT is a compact and self-contained token used for securely transmitting information between parties.

### Key Steps in JWT-Based Authentication

#### 1. **User Login**  
The user sends their credentials (e.g., `username` and `password`) to the **Authentication Service** via a login endpoint.

#### 2. **Token Generation**  
If the credentials are valid, the service generates a JWT token containing claims such as:  
- User roles (e.g., `ADMIN`, `USER`)  
- Expiration time  
- User-specific identifiers (e.g., `userID`)  

The token is signed using a secure key to prevent tampering.

#### 3. **Token Usage**  
The client includes the JWT token in the headers of their requests to other services. For example:  

### Flask Application That Runs the Fine-tuning Model

The Flask application serves as a lightweight API server that runs a machine learning model, making predictions based on input data. This application is part of a microservices architecture, focusing on serving model predictions via an API endpoint.

#### Service Components:

1. **Model Initialization:**
   - The model is loaded using the `llama_cpp` library, which interfaces with a pre-trained machine learning model, `unsloth-llama-3-q4_k_m`. The model is initialized using the `Llama.from_pretrained()` method. Inference is then performed by calling the `model.create_chat_completion()` function to generate responses based on input prompts.

2. **Eureka Registration:**
   - The Flask app is registered with the **Eureka** server as a microservice. During registration, the app sends service details such as the instance ID, host name, port, and status. This enables other services in the architecture to dynamically discover the Flask app through the **Eureka Discovery Service**.

3. **API Endpoint for Generating Responses:**
   - The Flask application exposes a POST endpoint at `/generate` that accepts a `prompt` as input and returns a response generated by the model. 
   - **Request Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "prompt": "---------------------"
     }
     ```
   - **Response Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "response": "-------------------------"
     }
     ```
